# Document Lineage System

A comprehensive document processing and lineage tracking system for business documents, with a focus on NAPAS ACH (Automated Clearing House) integration.

## Features

### Core Workflows
- **Document Upload & Processing**: Upload and process business documents
- **Term Extraction**: Extract business terms from documents
- **Classification**: Classify documents and terms
- **Enrichment**: Enrich extracted terms with additional metadata
- **Publishing**: Publish processed terms and documents
- **Consumption**: Consume and search through processed data

### Data Lineage
- **General Data Lineage**: Visualize relationships between data entities
- **NAPAS ACH Data Lineage**: Specialized lineage viewer for NAPAS ACH documents and schemas

## NAPAS ACH Data Lineage Viewer

The NAPAS ACH Data Lineage Viewer is a specialized component designed to map and visualize the relationships between NAPAS ACH documents, extracted terms, database schemas, and services. It provides a comprehensive view of how business documents flow through the system and map to technical implementations.

### Key Features

1. **Document-to-Term Mapping**: Tracks how terms are extracted from specific document sections
2. **Term-to-Schema Mapping**: Shows how business terms map to database schemas and tables
3. **Service Dependencies**: Visualizes how services depend on database tables and configurations
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Displays confidence levels for mappings and extractions
5. **Status Tracking**: Shows the status of various components (active, deprecated, pending, review)

### Data Structure

The viewer organizes data into several categories:

- **Documents**: Source documents (PDFs, Word docs) containing business requirements
- **Terms**: Business terms extracted from documents with definitions and metadata
- **Schemas**: Database schemas that implement the business concepts
- **Database Tables**: Specific tables within schemas
- **Services**: Microservices that consume the data

### Usage

To use the NAPAS ACH Data Lineage Viewer:

1. Navigate to the lineage section in the application
2. Select "NAPAS Lineage" from the available options
3. Browse through different categories using the filter buttons
4. Click on any item to view detailed information including:
   - Description and metadata
   - Source document information
   - Schema mappings
   - Confidence scores
   - Tags and relationships

### Example Data Flow

```
Document (DPG Middleware Integration Specification)
    ↓ extracts-to
Term (Message Routing Engine)
    ↓ maps-to
Schema (dpg_middleware)
    ↓ contains
Table (message_routing)
    ↓ depends-on
Service (DPG Service)
```

### Integration with Original Data

The component is designed to work with the original NAPAS ACH data records, including:
- Document metadata from `napas-documents.ts`
- Term definitions from `napas-ach-terms.json`
- Schema mappings and confidence scores
- Service dependencies and relationships
