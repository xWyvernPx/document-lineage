# üìù Work Log - RMI0001

## 2025-07-13

**T-01, T-02, T-03:** Completed dependency installation for React Query (@tanstack/react-query), Axios, and Zustand. All packages installed successfully with no conflicts. Also installed React Query devtools for development. Ready to proceed with Task T-04 (Setup Query Client).

**T-04, T-05, T-06:** Configured React Query client with optimized defaults (5min stale time, 10min gc time, retry logic). Created axios instance with environment-based configuration, request/response interceptors for logging, error handling, and auth. Implemented comprehensive TypeScript types for all API entities, stores, and hooks. Established dual-mode system foundation (mock/real API switching). Ready to proceed with Epic EP-02 tasks.

**T-07, T-08, T-09, T-10:** Implemented comprehensive API client architecture. Created reusable API client class with dual-mode support (mock/real). Added request interceptors for authentication, logging, and performance monitoring. Implemented response interceptors with enhanced error handling for different HTTP status codes. Environment configuration supports development, production, and mock modes with URL switching.

**T-12 (Partial - Connections):** Created connection store using Zustand with devtools integration. Implemented complete state management for SchemaConnection entities including CRUD operations, filtering, loading states, and error handling. Store supports optimistic updates and maintains selected connection state.

**T-16a, T-16b, T-16c:** Implemented complete connection management system. Created ConnectionApiService with dual-mode support (real/mock APIs), comprehensive mock service with realistic data and delay simulation. Developed React Query hooks for connection management including useConnections, useCreateConnection, useUpdateConnection, useDeleteConnection, useTestConnection, and crawling operations (useStartCrawl, useCrawlStatus, useCrawlHistory). Integrated with Zustand store for optimistic updates and state synchronization.

**AWS API Integration:** Successfully configured real API integration with AWS API Gateway at https://5g7oefhzwb.execute-api.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/dev/. Verified connections endpoint returns real data with proper CORS headers. Updated API client to default to real API mode instead of mock. Added debugging and monitoring capabilities for API calls.

**RMI0002 Complete:** Completed comprehensive React Flow lineage migration including all 11 tasks across 4 epics:

**Epic EP-01 (Dependencies & Setup):**
- T-001: Installed @xyflow/react with all required dependencies and TypeScript types
- T-002: Created ReactFlowLineage component with draggable nodes, controls, minimap, and custom styling
- T-003-T-005: Updated type definitions for React Flow compatibility with LineageNode, LineageEdge, LineageGraph interfaces

**Epic EP-02 (Component Development):**
- T-006: Created custom TableNode component for displaying table details with columns, icons, and handles
- T-007-T-008: Implemented node dragging, edge connections, and React Flow controls (zoom, pan, fit view)

**Epic EP-03 (Data Integration):**
- T-009: Replaced legacy lineage components with React Flow implementations
- T-010: Created lineageService.ts following existing API patterns with mock data support
- T-011: Implemented data transformation utilities in lineageTransformers.ts

**Epic EP-04 (Integration & Polish):**
- T-012: Added React Query hooks (useLineage, useMultipleLineage, useLineageRaw) with caching and prefetching
- T-013: Created comprehensive LineageIntegrationDemo showcasing all features
- T-014: Updated export barrel files with all new components, services, and types
- T-015: Documentation complete

**Key Components Created:**
- ReactFlowLineage.tsx: Main lineage visualization component
- TableNode.tsx: Custom React Flow node for table display
- ReactFlowLineageDemo.tsx: Demo component showing basic usage
- LineageIntegrationDemo.tsx: Comprehensive integration demo
- lineageService.ts: API service layer for lineage data
- lineageTransformers.ts: Data transformation utilities
- useLineage.ts: React Query hooks for lineage data

**Migration Benefits:**
- Modern React Flow library with better performance and user experience
- Draggable nodes with real-time position updates
- Built-in zoom, pan, and minimap controls
- TypeScript type safety throughout
- Seamless integration with existing React Query architecture
- Comprehensive data transformation layer for server compatibility
- Maintainable component architecture following existing patterns
