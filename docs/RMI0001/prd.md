# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

| Section | Field | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **1. Metadata** | Project Name | Document Lineage API Integration |
|  | Author | AI Senior Software Engineer |
|  | Stakeholders | Product Owner, Development Team |
|  | Created On | 2025-07-13 |
|  | Last Updated | 2025-07-13 |
|  | Version | v1.0 |

| **2. Problem Statement** | Description | The current Document Lineage MVP operates with mock data only, limiting its real-world applicability. Users cannot persist data, sync across sessions, or integrate with actual document processing pipelines. This integration is critical to transform the MVP into a production-ready application that can handle real document workflows and data lineage tracking. |

| **3. Goals & Objectives** | Business Goals | Enable production deployment, support real document processing workflows, provide persistent data storage |
|  | User Goals | Access documents across sessions, track real document lineage, collaborate on document analysis |
|  | Technical Goals | <300ms response times, 99.9% uptime, seamless migration from mock to real data |

| **4. Success Metrics** | Primary KPIs | API response time <300ms, successful data persistence 99.9%, zero data loss during migration |
|  | Secondary KPIs | User adoption rate post-migration, reduced support tickets, improved workflow completion rates |

| **5. Scope** | In Scope | React Query integration, Axios HTTP client setup, Zustand global state management, gradual migration strategy, dual mock/real API modes, optimistic updates, polling for real-time features |
|  | Out of Scope | Backend API development, AWS infrastructure setup, Authentication implementation (Cognito/OAuth), WebSocket real-time features |

| **6. User Personas** | Persona 1 | **Name:** Business Analyst <br> **Role:** Document Reviewer <br> **Needs:** Track document lineage, review classifications, access historical data |
|  | Persona 2 | **Name:** System Administrator <br> **Role:** Platform Manager <br> **Needs:** Monitor processing status, manage document workflows, ensure data integrity |

| **7. Key Use Cases / User Stories** | US-01 | As a Business Analyst, I want to view real document processing results, so that I can make informed business decisions |
|  | US-02 | As a System Administrator, I want data to persist across sessions, so that workflows aren't lost |
|  | US-03 | As a user, I want to switch between mock and real data modes, so that I can test features safely |
|  | US-04 | As a user, I want optimistic updates, so that the interface feels responsive during API calls |
|  | US-05 | As a user, I want real-time status updates, so that I can track document processing progress |

| **8. Functional Requirements** | FR-01 | Replace SWR with React Query for data fetching |
|  | FR-02 | Implement Axios as HTTP client with interceptors |
|  | FR-03 | Setup Zustand for global state management |
|  | FR-04 | Create dual-mode system (mock/real API) |
|  | FR-05 | Implement optimistic updates for better UX |
|  | FR-06 | Add polling for real-time document status |
|  | FR-07 | Preserve all existing mock data during migration |
|  | FR-08 | Toast notifications for error handling |
|  | Notes | Prioritize by MoSCoW: Must (FR-01-04), Should (FR-05-06), Could (FR-07-08) |

| **9. Non-Functional Requirements** | Performance | API response time <300ms for 95% of requests |
|  | Security | Prepare for OAuth/JWT integration with AWS Cognito |
|  | Reliability | 99.9% data persistence reliability |
|  | Usability | Seamless transition between mock and real modes |
|  | Maintainability | Clean separation of concerns, testable code structure |

| **10. Dependencies** | External APIs | AWS Lambda + API Gateway endpoints (to be provided) |
|  | Internal Systems | Existing React components, TypeScript interfaces |

| **11. Constraints & Assumptions** | Tech Stack | React + TypeScript + Vite, AWS Lambda backend, Node.js runtime |
|  | Regulatory | Standard web security practices, HTTPS for production |
|  | Operating Constraints | Gradual migration approach, maintain backward compatibility |

| **12. Risks & Mitigations** | Risk 1 | API endpoints not ready during development <br> **Mitigation:** Use placeholder endpoints and mock data fallback |
|  | Risk 2 | State management complexity with dual modes <br> **Mitigation:** Clear separation of concerns and comprehensive testing |
|  | Risk 3 | Performance degradation during migration <br> **Mitigation:** Incremental rollout and performance monitoring |

| **13. Milestones & Timeline** | Milestone 1 | PRD & Architecture Design – 2025-07-13 |
|  | Milestone 2 | Dependencies Installation & Setup – 2025-07-14 |
|  | Milestone 3 | Core Integration Implementation – 2025-07-18 |
|  | Milestone 4 | Testing & Documentation – 2025-07-20 |

| **14. Open Questions** | Q1 | All questions have been resolved through stakeholder consultation |
|  | Q2 | API contract details to be provided by backend team |

| **15. Appendix** | Reference Links | [Task Breakdown](breakdown.md), [Planning Task](../../task/planning_RMI0001.md) |
|  | Change Log | v1.0 - Complete PRD with requirements finalized |
