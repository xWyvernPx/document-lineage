## 🔍 Open Questions / Assumptions
**✅ ALL QUESTIONS RESOLVED - PLANNING COMPLETE**

### API & Backend Questions: ✅ ANSWERED
1. **Backend technology stack:** Node.js and AWS Lambda + API Gateway
2. **API endpoints status:** High-level setup in progress, detailed contracts to be provided later
3. **Base URL:** Dev (localhost) and prod environments
4. **Authentication:** OAuth/JWT with AWS Cognito (future implementation)
5. **API documentation:** Not available yet, will be provided

### Data & Entities Questions: ✅ ANSWERED  
6-10. **API details:** Placeholder endpoints will be used initially, detailed contracts pending

### State Management Questions: ✅ ANSWERED
11. **Global vs local state:** User session, document lists, current document state managed globally
12. **Optimistic updates:** Yes, preferred approach
13. **Caching strategies:** Use React Query defaults with simple configuration
14. **Real-time features:** Polling required

### Performance & UX Questions: ✅ ANSWERED
15. **Response times:** <300ms target
16. **Retry mechanisms:** Use React Query default retry options
17. **Error handling:** Toast messages sufficient
18. **Mock data preservation:** Yes, maintain for development/testing

### Migration Strategy Questions: ✅ ANSWERED
19. **Migration approach:** Gradual migration
20. **Dual API modes:** Yes, maintain both mock and real API modes
21. **Data preservation:** All existing users/data must be preserved

## ✅ Done Criteria
- PRD, Breakdown, and any other required docs are complete, reviewed, and approved.
- Tasks are actionable, estimated, and free of blocking ambiguities.
