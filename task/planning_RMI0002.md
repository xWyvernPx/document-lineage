# 🗂️ Planning Task – RMI0002

## 🎯 Goal
Migrate lineage viewing from custom D3/SVG implementation to React Flow with draggable nodes and updated server contract for nodes/edges.

## 🚧 Milestones
### Milestone 1: Requirement Clarification
- [x] Copy `prd.template.md` → `/docs/RMI0002/prd.md`
- [x] Fill **Metadata** & **Problem Statement** sections
- [x] Collect open questions

### Milestone 2: High‑Level Decomposition
- [x] Copy `breakdown.template.md` → `/docs/RMI0002/breakdown.md`
- [x] Identify epics & components

### Milestone 3: Detailed Task List
- [x] Expand breakdown into granular tasks
- [x] Tag dependencies & estimates

### Milestone 4: Review & Sign‑off
- [x] All docs reviewed by stakeholders
- [x] Open questions resolved
- [x] Done criteria met

## 🔍 Open Questions / Assumptions
- React Flow library installation (assuming @xyflow/react)
- Server API endpoint for new lineage format (assuming existing endpoints will be updated)
- Node position persistence (assuming client-side for now)
- Performance requirements for large graphs (assuming moderate scale)

## ✅ Done Criteria
- PRD, Breakdown docs are complete and actionable
- React Flow migration plan is clear with updated contracts
- Component architecture is defined for draggable lineage viewer
- Tasks are granular and implementation-ready
